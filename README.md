Crawled 100000 pages and used indexing, compression and query expansion to display results for search queries on books and compared them to results of Google and Bing with respect to performance and relevance.

Created Inverted Index for the search engine, used JUNG framework to create web graph. Created two Relevance model using vector space and based on Page Ranking, HITS which helped us to do link analysis. 
Used Gamma, Delta encoding system to compress the index.
